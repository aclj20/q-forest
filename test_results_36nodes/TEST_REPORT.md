## 🔬 Technical Details

### Problem Formulation

**Objective:**
```
Maximize: Σ benefits[i,j] × x[i,j]
Subject to: Σ costs[i,j] × x[i,j] ≤ 500

```

### Solution Method

1. **Preprocessing**: Convert heatmap to weighted graph
2. **Optimization**: Solve using classical SDP
3. **Postprocessing**: Visualize selected nodes

import pandas as pd

# Load solution matrix
solution = np.loadtxt('solution_36.csv', delimiter=',')
print(f"Selected nodes: {solution.sum()}")
print(f"Solution matrix:\n{solution}")

# Load benefits and costs
benefits = np.loadtxt('benefits_36.csv', delimiter=',')
costs = np.loadtxt('costs_36.csv', delimiter=',')

# Calculate metrics
total_benefit = np.sum(benefits * solution)
total_cost = np.sum(costs * solution)

print(f"\nTotal benefit: {total_benefit:.4f}")
print(f"Total cost: {total_cost:.2f}")
```

## 🔄 Compare with Different Budgets

To test budget sensitivity:

```bash
# Test with budget=300
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/optimize/classic \
  -F "benefits_file=@benefits_36.csv" \
  -F "costs_file=@costs_36.csv" \
  -F "budget=300"

# Test with budget=700
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/optimize/classic \
  -F "benefits_file=@benefits_36.csv" \
  -F "costs_file=@costs_36.csv" \
  -F "budget=700"
```

## 📝 Notes

- The solution uses SDP relaxation, which may slightly exceed the budget
- For 36 nodes (6×6), the problem is still efficiently solvable
- Larger grids (e.g., 20×20 = 400 nodes) will take longer
- The highlighted visualization clearly shows selected regions

---

## 🔜 Next Steps

1. **Experiment with different budgets** to see how selection changes
2. **Compare with quantum solver** (if available)
3. **Test with different images** (map.png, custom images)
4. **Try larger grids** (64, 100, 144 nodes)
5. **Analyze spatial patterns** in selected nodes
